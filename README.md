# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This is a beginner data science project using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn to predict survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle's Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categories)
- Feature engineering (e.g., `FamilySize`)
- Logistic regression modeling
- Model evaluation with train/test split
- Generating submission-ready predictions

## 📊 Libraries Used
